# Deep-Learning-MLP-Using-NumPy

## About The Project

1) Multi-Layer Perceptron was implemented in Python + NumPy, without the use of frameworks for deep neural networks,
2) was trained on mnist, cifar-10 datasets.


## Implemented modules

• Fully connected layer with various initialization options,

• activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, linear, ...),

• Softmax function,

• Optimizer class,

• objective function CrossEntropy,

• Dataset class,

• class DataLoader,

• batch_generator function, taking into account various sampling methods,

• data augmentation classes (pad, crop, scale, translate, rotate, noise, salt, pepper, hue, brightness, saturation, contrast,
blur),

• unit tests,

• class "container" of the model,

• overfitting on one batch,

• all calculations for a batch, aggregation by average.
